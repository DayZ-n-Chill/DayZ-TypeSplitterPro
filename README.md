# DayZ Type Splitter Pro

I've developed a custom script to manage and format the types.xml data for configuring DayZ's in-game economy. This script was created out of some minor dissatisfaction with existing tools that I felt lacked sufficient organization.

## What makes it pro?

Well, nothing really. It's nothing fancy or special. I just did not like how other splitters out there organized their files.

## What's the difference between yours and others?

Other splitters break down the basic categories but also leave an other.xml file or uncategorized.xml file. Within these files were types that I felt could be manually categorized. My version breaks these down into a few more categories and then also backs up your types.xml and adds the links to your new XML in the cfgeconomycore.xml for you.

### XML Created after the split

- ammo.xml
- animals.xml
- clothes.xml
- containers.xml
- events.xml
- explosives.xml
- food.xml
- seasonal.xml
- staticObjs.xml
- tools.xml
- uncategorized.xml
- vehicleParts.xml
- vehicles.xml
- weapons.xml
- wrecks.xml
- zombies.xml

I do still have an uncategorized cause I don't know where to put the watchtower and the fence, but if you have suggestions, leave them in the comments.

Feel free to edit this as you need. It is free to use as you will. The file is in the workshop download.

## Requirements

- Python 3

## Usage

1. Place this in the same folder as your types.xml
2. Double click the typeSplitter.py file
3. Watch the magic and Enjoy!

### Alternate Usage

I use VS Code Python Extensions so I can just push F5 to run Batch and Python code. I recommend it.
